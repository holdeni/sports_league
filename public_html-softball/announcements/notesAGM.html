<h1>Annual League Meeting</h1>

<div class="full-width">

<p>On Monday, April 18th the AGM for the league was held, attended by most team representatives. Below are
notes on the events of the evening.
</p>

<h3>Game Balls Distributed</h3>
<p>Each team was provided with 12 game balls for the season. <strong>All balls from prior seasons are NOT to be used
   during a game, only the ones provided at the meeting.</strong> Teams were provided
   enough balls for all their home games through the regular season (8) and the start of the double elimination tournament.
   Additionally, for the first couple of games of the season, teams should use 2 new balls in a game since they cannot
   play using prior season used game balls.
</p>

<h3>No Changes To Executive</h3>
<p>The existing executive board has agreed to continue for this season.</p>

<h3>Financials</h3>
<p>The financial report for 2010 actual spending and 2011 budget was provided. The league fee for each team in 2011 is 
   the same as last season, $1225. This amount is due no later than 1 June 2011.
</p>
<p>A proposal was passed stating that, starting in 2012, each team must pay $100 of their league fee for the year at the 
   AGM held before the season. This money would help fund the yearly startup costs that occur before the bulk of the
   league fees are collected.
</p>

<h3>Divisional Shuffle</h3>
<p>The following teams will be moving amongst the divisions for the 2011 season:
<ul>
   <li>Lightyear Technologies will move down to B Division</li>
   <li>ON Canadians will move up to A Division</li>
   <li>Longshots will move down to C Division</li>
   <li>The UPS STORE Pick-Ups will move up to B Division</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Games Begin May 2nd</h3>
<p>As in prior seasons, team will play a 16 game schedule followed by a double elimination tournament. Schedules
   are expected to be published by early next week. Due to holiday Mondays during the season, some teams will be
   scheduled for 2 games in a week, but this is very rare but unavoidable.
</p>
<p>This year, the league can see reimbursement of our diamond fee if a game is rained out. This requires that teams
   report rainout games by Noon the following day. Reimbursement of the fee will allow us to maintain diamond fees
   as budgeted as we can use the reimbursement to request extra time should we need to do so. Additional discussion
   occurred about when to declare a rainout and the exec would just like to emphasize that teams should try to wait
   as long as possible before declaring a rainout. We only have 2 extra slots a week in which to easily schedule rainouts
   and if games are cancelled improperly the executive reserves the right to outright cancel some games by not 
   rescheduling them. 
</p>

<h3>New Website Revealed</h3>
<p>Our website has been changed and improved. We're trying to drive more actions through the site, enabling team
   contacts to manage their own team details and submit game results online. This is only the beginning as more features
   are in the pipeline. Send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@kanatalobball.org"> the webmaster</a> if you 
   have suggestions, problems or compliments.
</p>

<h3>Rule and Constitution Changes</h3>
<p>There were a few changes and improvements that were discussed by team representatives. Changes to the rules and
   constitution will be written up before the season begins.
</p>

<ol>
   <li>Sliding: Discussion around whether sliding should be disallowed. No rule change, in the end, was proposed.</li>
   <li>Courtesy Runners: Discussion around whether once a player uses a courtesy runner in a game that the player
      must be required to use a Courtesty Runner for the remainder of the game. Rule change was proposed but 
      defeated.
   </li>
   <li>Allow a runner to advance from 3rd on a flyball: Annual discussion around this change ended with a proposal
      that was narrowly defeated.
   </li>
   <li>Courtesy Runners II: A proposal to disallow Courtesy Runners from home, the batter must be able to make it
      to first on their own, was defeated.
   </li>
   <li>Runners not out for touching home plate on a over-the-fence-homerun: Defeated.</li>
   <li>Add a tiebreaker for standings: A proposal to add a new tiebreaker, to be used after all current tiebreakers
      have been used, of a coin toss was PASSED.
   </li>
   <li>Article 3, Para 3.1 modification: A proposal PASSED to modify paragraph to clarify that
      teams that drop from B Division to C Division will have any players on their previous year's
      roster grandfathered against the 40 or older requirement.
   </li>
</ul>
