<h1>2014 Schedules - Updated: 21 May 2014</h1>

<div class="full-width">

<p>
The schedules for the 2014 season is now locked, at least the first 9 weeks. We have 9 teams so the schedule provides an 8-game round-robin season over a 9 week period. Each team has 1 week off. Following the round-robin we will then play some additional games until end of August - the exact format has not been decided upon.
