<h2>2014 Season - Less than a week and we are playing!</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Any team that has not paid their additional league fee of $100 is required to do so by Tuesday, May 20th. Payment should be made in the same manner the original $500 payment was made earlier this year.
</li>
<li>
An important note. The city diamonds we are using have games starting on them at 6:30pm. Therefore our games MUST end at 6:15pm. Teams may use the diamond until that time, but you must stop playing at 6:15pm. If you have to stop in the middle of an inning, then the score of the game will be of the last completed inning -- ties can still happen.
</li>
<li>
The league purchased 5 time slots each week. We always have the 4:45p to 6:15p slot on the South diamond each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. We have the same time slot on the North diamond 2 of these 3 days each week on a rotating basis. We have 4 games using these slots each week and then one open slot for convenient use for rescheduling. If required, we should be able to get the 3rd slot for the North diamond without too much effort.
</li>
<li>
The exception to the above is the week of July 1st where we do not have games scheduled on the holiday Tuesday but do have our
normal 4 games scheduled in the Wednesday & Thursday of the week.
</li>
<li>
As just mentioned, we do not have a lot of extra diamond time so weather related reschedules must only be declared when there isn't any safe opportunity to play the game. These diamonds have more shade close to the diamond so on hot days there is more opportunity to get some relief from the heat. For rain, the call whether a game should be played or not must be made at the field, as close to the game starting time as possible. The weather at the diamond can be quite different than the weather at your home or place of work. If a game does need to be rescheduled, please submit the game result noting this fact within 24 hours so that we can be reimbursed for the diamond cost (which we may use to get replacement time for the game).
</li>
<li>
Game balls are being bought and we will either announce a distribution time and locale before the season begins or will meet up with teams during the first week of the season.
