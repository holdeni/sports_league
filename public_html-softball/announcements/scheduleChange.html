<h1>Season Start DELAYED (Again)! Updated: 5 May @ 4pm</h1>

<div class="full-width">

<p>The City of Ottawa is now delaying the use of all sports fields until Tuesday (May 10th). This has caused
   us to reschedule the 2 games originally slated for Monday, May 9th.
</p>

<p>The following games have now been moved and the team contacts advised. Online schedules are up-to-date.
</p>

<pre>
   Willy's Pizza vs Slime - now on Tue, May 10th at 6:30 North <br />
   RBC Lions vs Century 21 (Tim McLean) - now on Mon, May 16th at 6:30 North
</pre>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Many people have pointed out that the PSA put out by the city mentions sports fields
   are not to be used until May 15th. Dennis has talked with our city representative and has confirmed that
   "sports fields" means non-ball diamonds. At this time, the city is asking we don't use the ball diamonds
   until Tuesday, May 10th. If all goes well, we shall be able to start our games Tuesday evening.
