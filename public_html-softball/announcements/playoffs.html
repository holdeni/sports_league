<h1>Playoffs - Updated: 8 Aug 2013</h1>

<div class="full-width">
<h2>2013 Playoffs</h2>
<hr />
<h4>UPDATE</h4>
<p>The final schedule for the 2013 season has been published. The schedule has been tweaked to accomodate the teams requesting late games only. Also, some dates
	later in the schedule were shuffled slightly since we are starting a week later than we had originally hoped for.
</p>
<hr />

<p>This season, we will again break the league up into 3 groups based upon the final standings
	from our regular season round-robin. Group A will consist of the top 4 teams, Group B of the next 5 teams and Group C of the bottom 4 teams. Each group
	will play one game against the other team in their group. Group winners will be the team with the best record at the end of this round robin. No game
	results from the regular season will carry forward into the playoff round robin.
</p>
<p>Teams in Group A and C will play a single game each week. Group B will see 4 of 5 teams play on a given group day with a single game in a week
	for 3 weeks and one week with 2 group days.
</p>
<p>Game results are to be submitted online, but use the <em>report playoff game</em> link. Standings will be published after all games for the week
	have been completed. Rainouts or game rescheduling can still occur. Some teams have indicated they have upcoming company events that affect a number of their
	players. If both teams involved in the game agree to reschedule, then submit it as a rainout. If you do it soon enough, the game can be rescheduled within
	the same week it was originally scheduled to avoid, when possible, teams having 2 games in a week.
</p>
<!--
<p>The draft schedule will be updated with actual team names once the final standings are decided. Teams that had asked for all their games to be at 6:15pm
	will continue to see that occur. For the simplicity of the draft schedule, games have simply been allotted to a day and will be assigned an appropriate
	time slot when we know the exact teams involved in each game.
