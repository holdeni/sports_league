<h1>KANATA MEN'S LOBBALL LEAGUE STRUCTURE AND RULES</h1>
<h3>Document Revision History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>11 April 2011 (by Ian Holden) Separated combined document into
individual documents. Addressed HTML formatting. Incorporated D-11
(Pinch Runner) rules based upon 2010 league meeting. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>A. &nbsp; STRUCTURE</h2>
<ol>
  <li>This document describes By-Law Number 1 of the league.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The league will be divided into three sections consisting of A
and B Divisions and a C, over 40, Division. The season will consist of
round robin play within the Divisions and double knockout playoffs
within the Divisions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>B. &nbsp; THE LEAGUE</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A player may only register with one team and must be 25 years of
age or older in the current calendar year in A and B Divisions and 40
years of age or older in the current calender year in the C Division.</li>
  <li>A team shall be allowed to sign an unlimited number of players.</li>
  <li>All league fees and initial team rosters including name, address,
telephone number and date of birth of all players must be submitted to
the League Executive prior to June 1st of the calendar year. Teams that
fail to submit team fees by this date will be expelled from the League.
Team lists may be modified during the year by written notification to
the League Executive. To be eligible to play in the league playoffs, a
player must have played in at least five league games (players injured
and on the bench are considered to have played). Teams should keep
official scorebooks that could be used to verify the eligibility of
players for the playoffs. Use of ineligible players in playoff games
will result in the team forfeiting the game(s) involved.</li>
  <li>A team must field a minimum of 8 of their own team players by the
schedule starting time or the game will be forfeited to the opposing
team.</li>
  <li>A maximum of 11 players will be allowed on the field at one time.
A team may utilize a maximum of 3 spares, who must be registered league
players, for any regular season game if they have between 8 and 10 of
their own team players by game time. The use of spares who are not
registered league players may be allowed upon the mutual consent of
both team Captains. If a regular team player shows up after a spare has
commenced play, both players shall be allowed to finish the game.</li>
  <li>Spares will not be allowed during the playoffs.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>C. &nbsp; BATTING</h2>
<ol>
  <li>All players shall be included in the batting order and shall bat
in rotation. The batting order shall remain the same throughout the
game.</li>
  <li>A team is allowed 3 outs or a maximum of 7 runs per inning,
whichever comes first. (For example, if the batting team has 6 runs
scored, two base runners and the batter hits a home run, the total runs
scored for the batting team will be seven.)</li>
  <li>The Home Plate will be 2' x 3'.</li>
  <li>The batter's box extends one foot behind the plate and three feet
in front of the plate. Both feet of the batter must be inside the
batter's box before the pitcher can deliver a pitch. If a batter makes
contact with an intended pitched ball while he is out of the batters
box, he will be called out. A batter is not considered out of the
batter's box if all or a part of his foot is in the area directly in
front of home plate and behind the three foot line. A batter can not
block the view of the plate by the pitcher.</li>
  <li>A batter will be called out if, while in his swing, he steps on
the plate and his bat makes contact with the ball. (stepping on the
plate while running to first base is not considered an out).</li>
  <li>Two strikes and Four balls.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>A foul tip on any strike, if caught, regardless of height, is an
automatic out.</li>
  <li>A batted ball which hits the plate is considered a foul ball.</li>
  <li>Fair ball and dead ball territory (re: foul balls) must be agreed
upon by the Captains at the beginning of the game.</li>
  <li>No bunting.</li>
  <li>Teams are allowed one homerun (fair balls hit over the fence) per
half-inning at bat. Subsequent homeruns (fair balls hit over the fence)
hit in the same half-inning will be considered ground-rule singles with
runner(s) advancing one base.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>D. &nbsp; PITCHING AND BASE RUNNING</h1>
<ol>
  <li>The pitcher shall deliver the ball from a designated pitcher's
area described as follows:</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Where a pitcher's rubber exists the
pitcher shall ensure that upon release of the ball at least one foot is
between the rubber and a line SIX feet from the rubber towards 2nd
base. In the absence of a visible pitcher's rubber, the forward
delivery line shall be in a straight line between first and third base.
The pitchers rubber will be designated as the intersection of a
straight line between first and third and a straight line between home
and second. If a ball is pitched from outside the prescribed pitcher's
area, the Umpire must call it a ball before it crosses the plate. If
the batter elects to swing, the ball will be in play.<br>
</div>
<ol start="2">
  <li>The arc of the ball must be over 6 feet from the ground. If a
pitch has an arc of less that 6 feet, the umpire must call it a ball
before it crosses the plate. If the batter elects to swing, the ball
will be in play.</li>
  <li>A strike shall be called if the ball strikes any part of the
plate with the proper arc or if the batter swings.</li>
  <li>A ball shall be called if the pitch misses the plate without the
batter swinging or if the arc of the ball is not over 6 feet from the
ground.</li>
  <li>No stealing. (Runner out)</li>
  <li>No sliding at home plate. (Runner out)</li>
  <li>A runner's commitment line shall be drawn across the third base
line three quarters of the distance to home plate. If any part of the
runner's body crosses this line, he must proceed to home plate and a
force play automatically comes into effect (no tag is necessary).</li>
  <li>No leading. A base runner who leaves the base before the batter
makes contact with the ball shall be called out.</li>
  <li>Runners on 1st and 2nd may tag up and run on a fly ball. A 3rd
base runner may not score on a fly ball. He must be hit in no matter
what action takes place after a fly ball. (Should a 3rd base runner
cross the commitment line on a fly ball, he shall be declared out).</li>
  <li>Spares will not be allowed to pitch.</li>
  <li>The use of courtesy runners is designed to allow players who have
been injured either prior to or during the game to be replaced by the
last player out. Use of a courtesy runner to replace a slow runner will
not be permitted. Except for players injured during the game, prior to
the game Team Captains shall declare up to two players for whom a
runner is required and the method the courtesy runner will replace the
batter. The two options for courtesy runners replacing batters are:</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>A base runner may be replaced by a courtesy runner after the
previous play has completed and before the next play begins.</li>
    <li>A courtesy runner may be used for the batter, starting at home
plate. The courtesy runner starts from the fence behind home plate
where the base line from 3rd base continues on to intersect the
backstop. The courtesy runner must maintain contact with the fence
until the batter makes contact with the ball (in a similar fashion as
the base runner must remain in contact with the base until the ball is
hit). If the courtesy runner loses contact with the fence early, the
batter is declared out.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Upon the ball being hit the courtesy runner at the plate may
only advance to first base and no further. In running to first, the
courtesy runner may take any path as long as the path does not
interfere with a fielder making a play on the ball. The courtesy runner
must use the orange side of first base or they are considered out.</li>
      <li>If the hit would normally be considered an automatic multiple
base hit (i.e.: ground rule double or home run), the hit will be
considered a single and the courtesy runner may only proceed to first
base and all other runners on base are limited to only 1 base
advancement without penalty of being put out. If the hit would normally
be considered a home run, it shall not count towards the number of home
runs allowed by the batting team in that half inning.</li>
      <li>If the ball is thrown out of play following the hit, the
courtesy runner is still limited to first base only. There is no
additional advancement for the courtesy runner. Other runners advance
as per regular rules.</li>
      <li>Unless governed by D-11-b-2 above or other restrictions on
advancement, all other base runners may advance multiple bases on the
hit with normal vulnerability to being put out.</li>
      <li>Upon the conclusion of the at bat that the courtesy runner
started at home plate (e.g. the next batter is at the plate), no
further restrictions are placed upon that courtesy runner while running
the bases.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Safe Line. A line drawn in foul territory starting at the top
left-hand corner of home plate perpendicular to the third base line. A
runner attempting to reach home plate must do so by touching the ground
in foul territory on or beyond the Safe Line. The runner is out if he
touches home plate whether or not a play is being made. A runner is not
out if the plate is touched in an attempt to avoid a collision.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>E. &nbsp; GENERAL</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Ground rules regarding home runs, (fences, long grass, trees,
etc.) shall be agreed upon by the two team Captains before the game.</li>
  <li>The infield fly rule applies.</li>
  <li>Only regulation bats shall be used unless approval is given by
the opposing team Captain.</li>
  <li>Player equipment<br>
  </li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>No metal cleats shall be permitted at any time.</li>
    <li>Any ball glove may be used in any position at any time.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Teams shall be awarded 2 points for a win and 1 point for a tie.
(if time permits and both team Captains agree, extra innings may be
played to break a tie.) No extra inning may commence unless there is
more that 15 minutes available prior to the scheduled start of the next
game. For late starting games no extra inning may start after 10:45
P.M. Lights must be turned off by 11:00 P.M. (See general rule No. 15).
Except to meet the minimum four inning game criteria no complete inning
may commence unless there is more than 10 minutes available prior to
the starting time of the next scheduled game.</li>
  <li>The winning team Captain or, in the event of a tie, the home team
Captain, shall email the score to the League Scheduler by 8:00 P.M. of
the Friday after game completion. Any game played including rainouts
not reported by 8:00 P.M. of the Friday after game completion will
count as not played and will not be rescheduled.</li>
  <li>Failure to comply with GENERAL RULE NO. 6 (above) may result in
no point being awarded for that particular game. The home team Captain
is responsible for the fair umpiring of the game and for providing
bases. The team at bat shall provide a plate umpire and at least one
base umpire.</li>
  <li>Each game shall consist of 8 innings. If a game is tied after 8
regular innings of play, extra innings may be played if time permits.
(See General Rule No. 5).</li>
  <li>The home team Captain shall notify the League Scheduler within 24
hours after a rained out game. However, the visitor team Captain should
also contact the League Scheduler within 24 hours to ensure the game is
rescheduled. The league will reschedule the rained out games.</li>
  <li>If it begins to rain during a game, the home team Captain will
have the final say as to whether the game shall continue (within
reason). Four full innings constitute a completed game. The home team
Captain shall notify the League Scheduler within 24 hours after the
rained out game. However, the visitor team Captain should also contact
the League Scheduler within 24 hours to ensure the game is rescheduled.</li>
  <li>Playoffs shall consist of a double knock out with all teams
participating.</li>
  <li>In all playoff games the home team shall be determined to be the
team with the highest standing from regular season play.</li>
  <li>Playoff standings shall be determined on the following criteria:</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Points from regular season play. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Record against that particular team.</li>
    <li>Total wins from regular season play. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Runs for and against that particular team. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Overall runs for and against.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>All league rules may be modified at any time by a majority
decision of the Team Captains and the League Executive.</li>
  <li>A special effort should be made by all teams playing on evenings
where multiple games are scheduled to ensure that all games go as
scheduled. Since lights must be turned off by 11:00 P.M., a game in
progress at that time will be considered a completed game if at least
four full innings have been completed. The score at the end of the last
full inning will determine the outcome of the game. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>F. &nbsp; OFTEN REFERRED TO "BALL PLAYING" RULES</h2>
<ol>
  <li>FAIR BALL is a batted ball that settles, or is touched on fair
territory between Home and First, Second or Third Base; or that while
in FAIR territory touches an Umpire or player; or that first falls on
fair territory beyond First or Third.</li>
  <li>INFIELD FLY IS A FAIR BALL which can be caught by an infielder
with ordinary effort when First and Second or First, Second and Third
are occupied, before two are out. The Umpire shall immediately declare
"Infield Fly - batter is out" if fair. The ball is alive and runners
may advance after the ball is touched.</li>
  <li>Batter is out if a fielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball
including a line drive, which can be caught by an infielder with
ordinary effort, with First, First and Second, First and Third, or
First, Second and Third base occupied and with less than two outs. Ball
is dead and runners must hold to their bases at the time of the pitch.</li>
  <li>Two base runners may not occupy the same base simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">EFFECT: the runner who first legally
occupied the base is entitled to it; the other base runner may be put
out by being touched with the ball. (Exception: on a force play, the
forced runner loses his right of occupancy and may be tagged out.)</div>
<ol start="5">
  <li>A player is liable to be tagged out if after overrunning First
base he attempts to continue to Second base.</li>
  <li>When the ball is in play and is overthrown (out of play) base
runners are awarded 2 bases. If the first throw is made by an
infielder, the awarding of the 2 bases is governed by the position of
the runners at the time the ball was delivered by the pitcher. When a
throw is made by an outfielder (or Rover) or is the result of any
succeeding play the two base award is governed by the position of the
runners and the last base touched at the time of the throw.</li>
  <li>The base runner is out if struck by a fair batted ball while off
base and before it passes an infielder, excluding the pitcher.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">EFFECT: the ball is dead, base runner
is out and no bases may be run unless forced by the batter becoming a
base runner. If runner is behind the infielder when hit by a batted
ball and doesn't interfere with another infielder making a play on the
ball, play continues and runner is not out.<br>
