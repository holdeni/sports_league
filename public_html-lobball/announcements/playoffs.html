<h1>Playoffs - Updated: 22 Aug 2013</h1>

<div class="full-width">

<h4>Official Schedule Posted</h4>
<!--
<p>The details for the playoffs are now available for viewing under Schedules. You can view the
   consolidated schedule for all divisions or just a specific division. Currently the schedules show
   the starting point for a division by the final standing position (e.g. 1st place would play where Seed 1
   is listed). The actual team names will be updated into the schedule when the standings are finalized. The
   schedules also show which game is next for the teams involved depending upon who wins or loses. When
   game results are submitted, the schedule will be automatically updated to help teams confirm when their
   next game will be.

	The details for the playoffs are now available for viewing under Schedules. You can view the
   consolidated schedule for all divisions or just a specific division. The
   schedules also show which game is next for the teams involved depending upon who wins or loses. When
   game results are submitted, the schedule will be automatically updated to help teams confirm when their
   next game will be.
</p>

<p>The Game Identifier column indicates the division (A, B or C) and the game number within the division's
   playoffs (e.g 1, 2, 3, etc). As noted on the schedules, the home team for each game (except the Finals)
   is the team that finished better in the standings. The home team in the Finals is determined differently.
   In the first final game, home team is the team who has not yet lost. For the 2nd game, if required, the
   winner of the 1st game is now the home team.
</p>

<p><strong>Import scheduling note:</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of spots in the schedule were a team will be required to play a 2nd game in the same
	week. These were minimized as much as possible but each division required some games to be scheduled as such.
</p>
<p>
	<em>A Division</em>
	<ul>
		<li>Winner of game A12 plays later in the same week (in game A13)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<em>B Division</em>
	<ul>
		<li>Winner of game B01 plays later in the same week (in game B05)</li>
		<li>Winner of game B06 plays later in the same week (in game B08)</li>
		<li>LOSER of game B13 plays later in the same week (in game B15)</li>
		<li>Winner of game B14 plays later in the same week (in game B15)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<em>C Division</em>
	<ul>
		<li>Winner of game B12 plays later in the same week (in game B13)</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<p>Four innings shall constitute a complete game (when the game is shortened due to rain, lighting, etc).
   Any Finals game will be a full 8 innings, regardless of timing, since the start time for them will be 7pm.
</p>

<p>Please make every effort to play your games in the timeslot scheduled.  Rain outs will be rescheduled only if
   absolutely necessary (e.g. the presence of lighting, or heavy rain). Games MAY be rescheduled quickly meaning
   that a game not played one night may be rescheduled to be played the next night so please be aware. Additionally,
   games rescheduling may cause changes to other unplayed games so please check the schedules online regularly. We
   will try to keep league members informed as to schedule changes the best we can.
</p>

<p>Regular season time restrictions apply for all playoff games unless the teams are tied at the
   end of a complete inning. Except to meet the minimum four inning game criteria no complete inning shall commence
   unless there is more than 10 minutes available prior to the starting time of the next scheduled game (or 11:00PM).
   In the event of a tie, and less than 10 minutes remaining, then the last team to be leading at the end of a complete
   inning shall be deemed the winner.
</p>

<p>Game results will be reported online through the web like regular season games. Just use the <em>report playoff game</em> link under
	Team Actions.
