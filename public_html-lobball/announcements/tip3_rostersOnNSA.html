<h1>Site Tip: Updating Your Online Roster With NSA - Updated: 12 June 2012</h1>

<div class="full-width">

<h4>
	Please note that the NSA website that you will be directed to in order to enter your roster information
	is a separate site from the Kanata Men's Lobball League. Any account you have on our league website,
	including email and password, is different from any account you may create on the NSA website in order
	to manage your roster details.
</h4>

<p>
	Teams have the option of updating their roster through the NSA website. If you wish to do so,
	follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<!--
	<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.nsacanada.ca/index.php">NSA website.</li>
	<li>Click on the <em>NSA Leagues</em> Tab and on the pull down menu, select on <em>Submit League Rosters Online<em></li>
-->
	<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.nsacanada.ca/leagues/roster.php">NSA Online Roster</a> page.</li>
	<li>If you are submitting a roster for the first time, you must follow the <strong>New Online Team Roster</strong> instructions. If you
		have already started a roster (whether from this season or from a past season), you must login to the site using the Yellow form
		on the page, providing your email address and the password you used on this site before. There is a link in the login
		form to have your password sent to you as a reminder.</li>
	<li>For a new roster, you will need to select <strong>Ontario</strong> (from the list above the map of Canada) and then click
		on the <em>List Leagues</em> button. From the list of leagues presented, jump to around page 8 (as of this writing) and
		find <strong>Kanata Men\'s Lob Ball League</strong> and then click on <em>Add a NEW Roster</em> beside it. On the next web page,
		fill out the info required as a team manager and click on <em>Submit and Continue to Player's List</em></li>
	<li>If you login to the site since you have an existing roster, review your team information and make any necessary updates.</li>
	<li>At the team roster info, the minimum info required for a player to be submitted is name, address, year of birth and gender.</li>
