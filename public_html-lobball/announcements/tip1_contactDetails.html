<h1>Site Tip: Maintaining Your Contact Details - Updated: 12 June 2012</h1>

<div class="full-width">

<p>
	This article will provide you information on how you, as a team contact or a member as a team,
	can ensure you stay informed about league events. As much as possible, we've tried to make
	things self-controlled so that you don't need to involve us in updating mailing lists.
	If you have questions about the instructions included here, contact
	<a href="mailto:webmaster@kanatalobball.org">the site webmaster</a>.
</p>

<p>
	There are two main points of contact, team (meant to direct communication at a specific team or set of teams) and general (league-wide communication).
</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Team Contacts</strong>:
		Each team is required to have at least 2 and up to 3 team contacts listed for their team.
		These email addresses are available to view from the <a href="http://kanatalobball.org/contacts">Contacts</a> navigation item. You can
		select whether to send email to a specific team contact or all contacts for a team. The list of
		contacts for a team can be updated any existing team contact. So if you have changes in
		your team's information, one of the currently listed contacts simply needs to access the website. In the
		left-hand navigation area, under <em>Team Actions</em> they will have the option to update team contacts.
		The site will then present a form where the existing email addresses are shown and can then be changed.
	<br />
		If a team contact doesn't show any phone numbers in the Contact list, this means that the person has not
		registered a web account on the site using the listed email address. Upon registering, the phone numbers
		provided will be be shown in the Contact information.
	<br />
		To protect the personal information available on the Contacts page, you must have an account on the web
		site and login using it before the information will be visible.
	</li>

	<br />

	<li><strong>Mailing List</strong>:
		We also have a general mailing list, <strong>aroundthehorn@kanatalobball.org</strong>, that anyone can be a member of.
		This mailing list is meant for both team contacts and interested team members. <strong>NOTE: TEAM CONTACTS </strong>
		must be registered to this list - failure to do so could result in missing information we send out
		and the exec accept no responsibility for any consequences from this failure.
	<br />
		To sign up to the mailing list <a href="http://kanatalobball.org/mailman/listinfo/aroundthehorn_kanatalobball.org">visit the admin page</a>.
		To add yourself to the list, follow the steps in the <em>Subscribing to Aroundthehorn</em> section.
	<br />
		To update your registered email address or to unsubscribe,visit <a href="http://kanatalobball.org/mailman/options/aroundthehorn_kanatalobball.org" >the personal admin page</a>.
		You can change from one email address to another or unsubscribe completely. The password that is required on
		this page is the one that the mailing list sends you monthly, it may not be the same as the one you use to
		login to the Lobball website. You can use the Password reminder feature to have the password sent to you via email.
	<br />
		If someone wishes to send an email to the members of the mailing list, address your email (using your favorite
		email client), to <a href="mailto:aroundthehorn@kanatalobball.org">aroundthehorn@kanatalobball.org</a>. This
		list is moderated so the message won't actually go out to the members until it has been reviewed and found as
		relevant to the intended audience.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Contacts To Send Email</h2>

<p>
	When you are viewing Contacts for a team, either for one team or a division or even the whole league, there are
	a couple of quick ways to direct an email to a specific contact or a team's contacts.
</p>

<p>
	To send an email to a specific address for a person, simply clink on the email address and a blank message should
	appear from your mail client with the selected address in the <strong>To</strong> list.
</p>

<p>
	To send an email to all the contacts for a team, simply clink on the team name and a blank message should appear
	from your mail client with all the addressess for the chosen team's contacts in the <strong>To</strong> list. If
	your mail client complains about the comma (,) between the email addresses or thinks that the addresses are just
	one long address, you may need to tweak the settings in your mail client. For Microsoft Outlook,
	<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/use-commas-to-separate-e-mail-addresses-HP005243134.aspx">
