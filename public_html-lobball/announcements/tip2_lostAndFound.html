<h1>Site Tip: Reporting Items Lost Or Found At Diamonds - Updated: 12 June 2012</h1>

<div class="full-width">

<p>
	If you find an item left behind at the diamonds or have left something behind yourself, we
	ask that you use either the Team Contacts or the general mailing list to send out a notice.
	If you know when the item was lost or found, please consult the league schedule
	and send your notice to the specific teams that could have been at the diamond. If you are unsure
	when the item might have been lost, sending an email to the general league mailing list is allowed but the message will
	be delayed as it must be reviewed by the list moderator before it actually gets out to the
	list membership.
</p>

<p>
	To learn more about the Team Contacts or general Mailing list, review the tip on <strong><em>Maintaining
	Your Contact Details</em></strong>.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Effective 12 June 2012</strong> anyone sending emails to the league executive about lost and found items will be
	referred to this tip. Everyone has the ability to contact the appropriate teams.
